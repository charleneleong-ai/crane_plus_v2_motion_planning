# Title
- 7 THU 13:00～ @ TOWN (2F)
- about 2~30 min ? (longer is also OK)
- may change to Friday
- If you don't have enough time, I will support you !

----

# Agenda

----

# Self Introduction
- brief one is good
- copy of powerpoint you made before
- I also invite all members of this department and some may not know about you

----

# Overview of this Training
- sentence
- a few figure or movie are good for understanding

### Copy of invitation mail I sent
She studied path planning for small robot arm.
There are some good methods for path planning.
These methods have some hyperparameters and we usually use default recommended value.
In this time, she applies black-box function optimisation method and aims to find better parameter than default one.

# Introduction of reference paper
- Automatic Parameter Tuning of Motion Planning Algorithms
- I forgot title of another paper

----

# Explanation of your studies
- Introduction of robot arm
- Introduction of path planning methods
  + only list-up and write references is OK
  + number of hyperparameters
- Introduction of black-box function optimisation methods
  + What is black-box? 
    * relationship between parameters and evaluation value is unknown
    * cannot calculate gradient
  + paste screenshot of Excel
    * summary of optimizations and libraries you wrote before)
    * to say you did a great survey

----

# Simulation
- screenshot or demonstration

----

# Experiments (setting)
- your environment
- setting
  + start position and goal position
  + try * times
    * If you have enough time, please try some times with same setting and calculate mean and deviation value
  + area of search
  + time bounded for optimisation : 2 hours
  + ･･･

----

# Experiments (setting)
- matrix (combination)
  + I think it is easy to understand

| method | BiTTTR | BKPIECE | RRTConnect |

# Experiments (result)
- make a graphs by each path planning method
- graph1
  + vertical axis : optimisation value
  + horizontal axis : time
- graph2
  + vertical axis : optimisation value
  + horizontal axis : number of searches
- demonstration
  + compare default one and the best one

# Consideration
- itemized form is good

# Conclusion & Discussion
- itemized form is good

# Future works
- itemized form is good
